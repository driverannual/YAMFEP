YAMFEP is an easy-to-use Photoshop script that activates specific layers by name (can be text, photos, or shapes), exports them as JPG, and deactivates them. You can automate repetitive tasks like creating email signatures for 50 people, or anything you need, saving valuable time.
# Download
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/driverannual/YAMFEP/releases/tag/release) and download the ZIP file. So you can export in any local you want.

### How to use
1. Add the names of the layers you want to export in the 'config.json' file, then save it.
2. Turn off those layers in your PSD.
3. Open the 'File' menu, go to 'Scripts', and select 'Browse'.
4. Run script.js.
5. The exported JPG files will be saved in the same folder as your PSD.

Easy as it should be.

Feel free to add functions, just add a PR :)
