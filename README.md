# YAMFEP - Yet Another Multi-File Exporter For Photoshop
YAMFEP is an easy-to-use Photoshop script that activates specific layers by name (can be text, photos, or shapes), exports them as JPG, and deactivates them. You can automate repetitive tasks like creating email signatures for 50 people, or anything you need, saving valuable time.

# Download
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/driverannual/YAMFEP/releases/tag/release) and download the ZIP file. So you can export in any local you want.

### How to use
1. Add the name of the layers you want to export in the config.json file;
2. Turn off them in your PSD;
3. Open the 'File' menu, go to 'Scripts' and then 'Browse';
4. Run 'script.js';
5. The file will be saved in your PSD folder.

Easy as it should be.

Feel free to add functions, just add a PR :)
